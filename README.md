Project Plan
1. Initial Preprocess of Data
	Consider if PIL is correct for Images
		if yes, crop and change to change data for testing and convert to DataFrame and include classification (D, M, N)
	Need Single DF with one feature for classification (y-var)
	Split test-train
2. Run Tests
	Identify Accuracy of tests
	2a. OPTIONAL: Additional Preprocessin of Data to Improve Accuracy
		Add constrast to images, rotating images, etc
3. Identify Conclusions
	Compare three tests (DecTree, SVM, and KNN) accuracy with constant processing time (import clock)
	Report Results

Tasking: (FINAL PROJECT 4/21)
INDIVIDUALLY (Each participant will:)
1. Initial Processing of the Data
2. Perform One Test Each
	SVM:		Luis
	DecTree:	Sam
	KNN:		Rich
3. Make Model Program
